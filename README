I used this an (useless) application to cheat on flash games like "ClickChallenge" :-)
However it can be adapted to interact in other ways with the computer, like simulate
a user that press keyboard buttons or move the mouse and click in a particular position.
To allow this I used the simple Java Robot class.
In this case it repeatedly clicks in the specified position.
There are two ways to use the clicker:
- the first one is specifying the amount of clicks to perform;
- the other way allow to click continuously for a specified amount of seconds.
Just one of the two can be executed at time.
When a button is clicked instead of starting to click, there is a countdown of 5 seconds that
allow the user to position the mouse in the point where to click repeatedly.

In this repository there is the package clicker that contains all classes needed:
- clicker.java: the class that uses the java Robot class and provide two operations
- GUI.java: a class that provide the user interface and uses the previous class.

There is also a file zip that contains both source, compiled files.
Moreover there is a jar file to execute directly the program.
